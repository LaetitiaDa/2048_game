2048 game in JQuery, HTML and CSS

My second project in Jquery and 4th project for school. 
It was a school project that I developped in 3 days.

It uses an HTML table and classes display images. 
I used here the random function to be able to generate classes on random td.
Then, I built the functions to move (right, left, up, down) all the boxes.
Afterwards, I created the function to add them up by changing the casses.
Combine everything and here is the game!

I didn't add the images files here.
